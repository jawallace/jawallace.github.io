My name is Jeff Wallace, and I am a senior at Northeastern University studying toward a Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science and Physics, with a minor in Mathematics. Through Northeastern's co-op program, I have gained approximately 14
months of full-time experience working on a team of software developers in an agile environment. During these work
experiences I have worked on both production and prototype systems utilizing a variety of technologies.

<p>
My first co-op was at Basis Technologies, Inc in Cambridge, Massachussetts where I worked on Autopsy, an open-source
digital-forensics application built on top of the popular SleuthKit forensics framework. 
<br/>
My accomplishments at Basis included:
<ul>
    <li>contributing bug fixes</li>
    <li>improving the testing framework</li>
    <li>implementing a CI system</li>
    <li>improving the UI</li>
    <li>overhauling and extending the email ingest module</li>
</ul>

More recently, I joined Charles River Analytics' Decision Management division as a software engineering intern. As part
of a team of scientists and developers, I worked on a prototype web application utilizing semantic web technology to
streamline the development of training programs for a government customer. I joined the team early in the engineering
process and played a critical role in the major design and development tasks.

My accomplishments at Charles River Analytics included:
<ul>
    <li>designing and implementing a RESTful API</li>
    <li>implementing an abstraction layer over several document repository implementations</li>
    <li>implementing a prototype crowdsourcing system leverging a machine learning algorithm</li>
    <li>implementing a prototype automated training authoring system</li>
    <li>creating a document processing pipeline using Apache Camel</li>
    <li>maintaining and extending a MySQL relational database</li>
    <li>constructing and testing semantic queries using SPARQL</li>
    <li>implementing, testing, and improving a web-based UI</li>
</ul>
